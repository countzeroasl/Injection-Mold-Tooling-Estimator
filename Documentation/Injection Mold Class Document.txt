Class: Injection Mold

Purpose: To encapsulate the configuration data and relevant cost elements of a
completed injection mold.


Data:

X Mold width: part width * (Cav/2) + extra steel/slide steel/runner steel
X Mold Height part height * (Cav - (Cav/2)) + extra steel/slide steel/runner
  steel
- Mold Stack: Plates + Part height
X # Slides
- Core/Cav Steel
X # Lifters
- Slide Steel
- Lifter Steel
- Runner type:
	- hot runner/valve gate needs to account for cav when > 1 (non-linear)
- Unscrewing core?
- Hydraulic Core?
- Cal rods, oil heat, or water heat?
X core/cav complexity (int or float multiplier)
X slide complexity (int or float multiplier)
X lifter complexity (int or float multiplier)


Functions:

- Recalculate Mold Base size
- Recalculate runner size
